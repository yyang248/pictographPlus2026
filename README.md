# pictograph2
PICTograph2 infers the clonal evolution of tumors from single or multi-region sequencing data. The tool models uncertainty of mutation cellular fraction (MCF) in small somatic mutations (SSMs) and copy number alterations (CNAs), assigning SSMs and CNAs to subclones using a Bayesian hierarchical model, and reconstruct tumor evolutionary trees that are constrained based on principles of lineage precedence, sum condition, and optionally by sample-presence. The inputs to PICTograph2 are variant ("alt allele") read counts of SSMs, sequencing depth at the SSM loci, and the somatic CNA of the tumor genome. Tumor purity and the number of mutant alleles (multiplicity) are optional parameters. If multiple tumor samples are considered, an option is available to restrict the number of possible evolutionary trees by partitioning mutations according to sample presence. PICTograph2 summarizes the posterior distributions of the mutation cluster assignments and the MCFs for each cluster by the mode. The estimates of cluster MCFs are then used to determine the most probable trees. Multiple trees that share the same score can be summarized as an ensemble tree, where edges are weighted by their concordance among constituent trees in the ensemble.

## Installation

### JAGS
PICTograph2 uses the JAGS library for Bayesian data analysis, which is installed outside of R. JAGS can be downloaded and installed for your OS [here](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io).

### PICTograph2

```
devtools::install_github("KarchinLab/pictograph2", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
## Tutorial

### vignette

A vignette that includes a toy example is available in R. It is similar to the Tutorial listed below.

```
library(pictograph2)
vignette("pictograph2", package = "pictograph2")
```

### 1. Input data

Pictograph2 takes input data in multiple formats for flexible user inputs:

1) A single csv file that contains SSM and CNA information. 

* The first option is to provide a single csv file that contains at least columns named "sample", "mutation", "total_reads", "alt_reads", "tumor_integer_copy_number", and "cncf". Example input files can be found under "inst/extdata/examples". Set cncf to 0 if a mutation has no copy number alteration. See files that start with example1.

* NOTE: using this option will generate trees with SSMs only, CNA will not be assigned to clusters but only used for VAF correction. If you want to treat CNA as separate events, using the next two input formats.

* SSM file with minimal information

    | sample | mutation | total_reads | alt_reads | tumor_integer_copy_number | cncf |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
    | sample1 | mut1 | 100 | 67 | 4 | 0.8 |
    | sample1 | mut2 | 100 | 67 | 4 | 0.8 |
    | sample2 | mut1 | 100 | 40 | 2 | 1 |

* Users can also provide an optional column "major_integer_copy_number" that provides the information of the integer copy number of the major allele. If "major_integer_copy_number" is not provided, it will be estimated using an internal function built in the package. Example input files can be found under "inst/extdata/examples". See files that start with example2.

* SSM file with major_integer_copy_number column

    | sample | mutation | total_reads | alt_reads | tumor_integer_copy_number | major_integer_copy_number | cncf |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
    | sample1 | mut1 | 100 | 67 | 4 | 3 | 0.8 |
    | sample1 | mut2 | 50 | 67 | 3 | 2| 1 |
    | sample2 | mut1 | 100 | 50 | 4 | 3| 0.7 |

* Another optional column is "purity" column that provides the information of normal contamination of a sample. Putiry of 0.8 wil be used if not provided. 

* SSM file with major_integer_copy number and purity columns

    | sample | mutation | total_reads | alt_reads | tumor_integer_copy_number | major_integer_copy_number | cncf | purity |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- |
    | sample1 | mut1 | 100 | 67 | 4 | 3 | 0.8 | 0.9 |
    | sample1 | mut2 | 50 | 67 | 3 | 2| 1 | 0.9 |
    | sample2 | mut1 | 100 | 50 | 4 | 3| 0.7 | 0.9 |

2) Two csv files, one for SSM and one for CNA

* The second option is to provide the SSM read counts and copy number alterations (CNA) in two separate files. In this case, the SSM file should contain columns "sample", "mutation", "total_reads", "alt_reads", "chrom", "start", and "end". The "purity" column with be optional. The CNA file should contain columns "sample", "chrom", "start", "end", "tcn" and "baf". See files that start with example3.

* SSM file

    | sample | mutation | total_reads | alt_reads | chrom | start | end |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
    | sample1 | mut1 | 100 | 67 | chr1 | 10 | 1000 |
    | sample1 | mut2 | 50 | 67 | chr2 | 2000| 3000 |
    | sample2 | mut1 | 100 | 50 | chr1 | 10 | 1000 |

* CNA file with baf column

    | sample | chrom | start | end | tcn | baf |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
    | sample1 | chr1 | 10 | 1000 | 3.6 | 0.3 |
    | sample1 | chr2 | 2000| 3000 | 3.4 | 0.3 |
    | sample2 | chr1 | 10 | 1000 | 3.6 | 0.4 |

3) Three csv files, one for ssm, one for CNA, and one for germline heterozygous single nucleotide variants (SNV)

* In the absence of the baf column, users should provide an additional file that contains the count of the heterozygous germline SNVs that has the information about the "chroms", the "position" of the germline heterozygous SNV, "ref" and "alt" allele, and the reference and altenative reads counts in germline (normal) sample as well as all other samples. Note: the sample name should matched the sample name used in the SSM and CNA file. See files that start with example4.

* SSM file

    | sample | mutation | total_reads | alt_reads | chrom | start | end |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
    | sample1 | mut1 | 100 | 67 | chr1 | 10 | 1000 |
    | sample1 | mut2 | 50 | 67 | chr2 | 2000| 3000 |
    | sample2 | mut1 | 100 | 50 | chr1 | 10 | 1000 |

* CNA file
    | sample | chrom | start | end | tcn | 
    | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
    | sample1 | chr1 | 10 | 1000 | 3.6 |
    | sample1 | chr2 | 2000| 3000 | 3.4 |
    | sample2 | chr1 | 10 | 1000 | 3.6 |

* SNV file of germline heterozygous SNVs

    | chroms | position | ref | alt | germline_ref | germline_alt | sample1_ref | sample1_alt | sample2_ref | sample2_alt |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | chr1 | 20 | A | C | 50 | 50 | 70 | 30 | 60 | 40 |
    | chr1 | 50 | G | T | 55 | 45 | 76 | 34 | 80 | 20 |

### 2. Run PICTograph2 using the main function

Run an automated pipeline of the tool using the function mcmcMain. The only required user input is the "mutation_file", along with the "copy_number_file" and "SNV_file" if using format 2 or 3 mentioned above. Users can specify the destination of output files using "outputDir" option. If the outputDir is not specified, output files will be stored in the current working directory.

```
# here we use the example1 file as a demo
mcmcMain(mutation_file=system.file('extdata/examples/example1_snv.csv', package = 'pictograph2'), outputDir=system.file('extdata/examples/output', package = 'pictograph2'))
```

This will run PICTograph2 and save the output files in 'extdata/examples/output' directory.

### 5. Models

Two JAGS models are implemented within the package. Let's first go over the notations.

#### Model variables

* $I$ : number of mutations (SSMs and CNAs, if applicable)
* $S$ : number of samples
* $y$: variant read counts
* $n$: total read counts
* $tcn$: (fractional) total copy number
* $icn$: integer copy number
* $M$: major allele copy number
* $cncf$: copy number cellular fraction
* $m$: multiplicity for mutation
* $h$: indicator of whether a mutation is a CNA; $h_i = 1$ if mutation $i$ is a copy number alteration varaint (i.e. from the copy number file)
* $K$ : latent number of clusters
* $Z$ : latent cluster assignment of mutations
* $mcf$: cluster mutation cellular fraction

#### Model 1: estimates $icn$, $m$, and $cncf$ using SSMs in copy-neutral region and CNAs

<img src="inst/extdata/model1.png" alt="The first model of Bayesian Hierarchical Model" title="Model 1 Diagram" width="75%">


#### Model 2: use the  $icn$, $m$, and $cncf$ estimated from model 1 and estimate all parameters in all mutations

<img src="inst/extdata/model2.png" alt="The second model of Bayesian Hierarchical Model" title="Model 2 Diagram" width="75%">


#### If only a single SSM file is provided as input, model 2 will be used

| type of input | model used | sample presence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| single SSM file | second model | optional |
| SSM file with CNA file (with or without germline SNV file) | first and second model | optional
